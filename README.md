# UX Contact Form
### This component was built using sprint framework created by me (Inacio Agostinho Uassire)
**Version 1.0.0**

Hi, this is simple contact form that allow users to save messages to the database.

---

## Installation and configuration
Just push the code to your local repo or download as zip and extract to your local repo. Access the .env file and edit the database configuration as well the root path.

```php
//Database user
DB_USER="root"

//Database passord
DB_PASSWORD=""

//Database name
DB_NAME="uxcontactform"

//Root path where the project is located in public_html, www or the htdocs
APP_ROOT="uxcontactform/"
```

After setting the correct parameters, just run the code. No need to create the tables only just create the database, as the code runs in sprint framework created by me and it has the schema_auto_run set to true, which allows the schemas to run automatically and create all necessary tables.
